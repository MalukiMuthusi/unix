Unix Stream sockets.
===================

This is a simple program that creates a client and a server that interact through unix sockets.
The client reads input from the STDINFILE and writes to a socket.
The server reads from the clients socket and writes to the STDOUTFILE.

How the server works
====================

The server creates a socket. It checks the provided file path if it exists.
The server then binds an address to the socket path.
It then listens for connections.
The server accepts connections from clients.
It creates a new socket for each client. The server and the client use this new socket to exchange data.

This is an interactive server. The server processes a single client request at time. It blocks other clients.
